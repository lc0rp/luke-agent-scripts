# Doc Review Checklist

Correctness:

- Does the page match current product behavior?
- Is `source_of_truth` real and verifiable?

Intent purity:

- Is the `type` correct?
- Does the page avoid mixing tutorial + reference + concept?

Findability:

- Is the title clear and searchable?
- Can a new reader find this page from the relevant hub?

Actionability (Tutorial/How-to):

- Are prerequisites listed?
- Are steps complete and safe?
- Is there a validation step?
- Are common failure modes covered?

Maintainability:

- Is content duplicated across pages?
- If the same fact appears in multiple places, is there a single canonical page?

Trust:

- If security or access control matters, does the page describe it clearly?
- If data handling matters, does the page describe it clearly?
